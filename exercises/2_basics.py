# this is a comment
# anything following a hashtag is ignored by the interpreter
# it even works if you start a comment halfway through a line
blah = 50 # wow, cool, blah is equal to 50

""" 
you can make multiline comments 
by enclosing the whole thing
in triple quotes

the interpreter will not care about anything in these triple quotes

# assign value to variable
foo = 'hello'
bar = 'world'

lorem = 25
ipsum = 26

baz = foo + bar
sit = lorem + ipsum

# print() is a function that shows us the contents of the specified variable when the code is executed
print(baz)
print(sit)

# variables can't start with a number or contain spaces
# both will cause error if uncommented:
# 9cool = cool
# wow nice = "super cool"

### EXERCISES:

# 1. Can you overwrite an already-assigned variable with a new value?

# 2. Are variable names case-sensitive?
