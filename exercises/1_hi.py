# this is a comment. the python interpreter ignores any text that follows a #.

# let's get our interpreter working.

# try running this line alone in an interactive python session (REPL)
# navigate to the line (or highlight it with your mouse) then run it with the shortcut Shift + Enter
print('hello world')

#       python exercises/1_hi.py
print('wassup')
