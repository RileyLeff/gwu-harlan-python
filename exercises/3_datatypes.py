# the values assigned to a variable are of a certain "data type"

# you can check which type a value is with the function type(variable)

# text
var1 = "this is a string" # str

# numbers
var2 = 25 # int
var3 = 25.0 # float

# boolean
var4 = True # bool
var5 = False # bool

# empty / missing value
var6 = None # none!

# multi-value types
var7 = [0,1,2,3,4] # list
var8 = (1,2) # tuple

# hashmap! aka dictionary aka dict
var8 = {'riley': 2, 'keryn':39, 'tommy':500} # dict

# checking type 
type_of_var8 = type(var8)

# you can convert between types using some handy functions
x = 1.0
print(x)

# uncomment these lines to try converting x (float) to x (str)
# x = str(x)
# print(x)

# exercises:

# 1. what is this code going to print out?
x = str(1.0)
print(x * 2)
